# WordPOP
## About 

The idea behind the development of WordPOP application is a memorising app. The main goal of the
app is to create a single application that keeps track of various terms, encountered either in studies or
professional settings, their definition or meaning and learning the terms through practice and
gamification. The app can be used in place of flashcards for exams, or memorising different
terminology
